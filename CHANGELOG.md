### Fixed

- Fix an issue where the extension fails to build on ARM64 Linux. (patch [c350f4cc](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/c350f4cc6c7e37aefdd03db1ca3dc2bcc4ca2524))

## 2.13.1

_Published on 2024-11-06._

### Added

- Add `reported_by` tag to errors reported by the legacy error backend. This makes it easier to understand whether an error is being reported by the error backend. (patch [440e53dd](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/440e53ddc57ad2b6e974f7cda3701b9ca44cf0d1))
- Set the app revision config option for Scalingo deploys automatically. If the `CONTAINER_VERSION` system environment variable is present, it will use used to set the `revision` config option automatically. Overwrite it's value by configuring the `revision` config option for your application. (patch [dc86ad85](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/dc86ad85c96ddab01a44300d9ed2131a68f4cc77))

### Changed

- Change the primary download mirror for integrations. (patch [f3d201c1](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/f3d201c1b8e30fda35898780299509026d29a0af))

### Fixed

- Fix parentheses warning for Tesla on Elixir 1.17.x. (patch [6a62ea1a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/6a62ea1a86e9b203f13df78e1d1315b8d61f463e))
- Fix an issue where, after a certain amount of time, check-ins would no longer be sent.

  This issue also caused the default Hackney connection pool to be saturated, affecting other code that uses the default Hackney connection pool.

  (patch [7233adfa](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/7233adfa3b7a5fc16e523f00bbd85a42e8cbc148))

## 2.13.0

_Published on 2024-09-26._

### Added

- Add support for heartbeat check-ins.

  Use the `Appsignal.CheckIn.heartbeat` method to send a single heartbeat check-in event from your application. This can be used, for example, in a `GenServer`'s callback:

  ```elixir
  @impl true
  def handle_cast({:process_job, job}, jobs) do
    Appsignal.CheckIn.heartbeat("job_processor")
    {:noreply, [job | jobs], {:continue, :process_job}}
  end
  ```

  Heartbeats are deduplicated and sent asynchronously, without blocking the current thread. Regardless of how often the `.heartbeat` method is called, at most one heartbeat with the same identifier will be sent every ten seconds.

  Pass `continuous: true` as the second argument to send heartbeats continuously during the entire lifetime of the current process. This can be used, for example, during a `GenServer`'s initialisation:

  ```elixir
  @impl true
  def init(_arg) do
    Appsignal.CheckIn.heartbeat("my_genserver", continuous: true)
    {:ok, nil}
  end
  ```

  You can also use `Appsignal.CheckIn.Heartbeat` as a supervisor's child process, in order for heartbeats to be sent continuously during the lifetime of the supervisor. This can be used, for example, during an `Application`'s start:

  ```elixir
  @impl true
  def start(_type, _args) do
    Supervisor.start_link([
      {Appsignal.CheckIn.Heartbeat, "my_application"}
    ], strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApplication.Supervisor)
  end
  ```

  (minor [7b2ff327](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/7b2ff327b7f915a7245c4ad6f4dfd0f3c6b13ff5))

### Changed

- Send check-ins concurrently. When calling `Appsignal.CheckIn.cron`, instead of blocking the current process while the check-in events are sent, schedule them to be sent in a separate process. (patch [e7cead98](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/e7cead9880d537f384e64f85330db819d1d66148))

## 2.12.3

_Published on 2024-08-26._

### Fixed

- Make `Appsignal.Ecto.Repo`'s `default_options/1` function overridable. If your Ecto repo uses `Appsignal.Ecto.Repo` and implements its own `default_options/1`, it must call `super` to merge its default options with those of `Appsignal.Ecto.Repo`:

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyEctoRepo
    use Appsignal.Ecto.Repo

    def default_options(operation) do
      super(operation) ++ [
        # ... your default options here ...
      ]
    end
  end
  ```

  (patch [3d9634c7](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/3d9634c7a16999f45b8fcb64024f6b29cdaead4d))
- Fix an issue where Ecto transactions in parallel preloads would not be instrumented correctly when using `Appsignal.Ecto.Repo`, causing the query in the Ecto transaction to not be instrumented and the sample to be incorrectly closed as an earlier time. (patch [d5e132e0](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/d5e132e0bdba6ae0256d336ce0c087e29c9efb4e))

## 2.12.2

_Published on 2024-08-14._

### Changed

- Rename heartbeats to cron check-ins. Calls to `Appsignal.heartbeat` and `Appsignal.Heartbeat` should be replaced with calls to `Appsignal.CheckIn.cron` and `Appsignal.CheckIn.Cron`, for example:

  ```elixir
  # Before
  Appsignal.heartbeat("do_something", fn ->
    do_something()
  end)

  # After
  Appsignal.CheckIn.cron("do_something", fn ->
    do_something
  end)
  ```

  (patch [1c3b9c67](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/1c3b9c671544816486b9b1cc69c3400a672c42fb))

### Deprecated

- Calls to `Appsignal.heartbeat` and to methods in `Appsignal.Heartbeat` will emit a deprecation warning at compile-time. (patch [1c3b9c67](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/1c3b9c671544816486b9b1cc69c3400a672c42fb))

## 2.12.1

_Published on 2024-06-25._

### Fixed

- [990f3b26](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/990f3b26817d579c6eb32b1f84a78db529f53181) patch - When running the installation script on Microsoft Windows, some components threw an error. AppSignal doesn't support Windows, so the installation script won't run on Windows anymore. Preventing errors from raising.

## 2.12.0

_Published on 2024-06-05._

### Changed

- [6ce84310](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/6ce843108bd105053eca4ef268caaf9a69ecbc32) minor - Group GraphQL queries by operation names if available. It will no longer group all errors and performance measurements under the same action name. If no operation name is set, it will use the default action name of the HTTP request route, like `POST /graphql`.
  
  If you do not wish to use the operation name, or customize the action name for the GraphQL query request, use the `Appsignal.Span.set_name` in a plug middleware that is called before or after the HTTP request is made:
  
  ```elixir
  Appsignal.Span.set_name(Appsignal.Tracer.root_span(), "MyActionName")
  ```

## 2.11.0

_Published on 2024-06-04._

### Added

- [4508bd10](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/4508bd10f8480fa2a9eea077f0f2f5c3a8dec4eb) patch - Add `Appsignal.Span.set_name_if_nil` helper. This helper can be used to not overwrite previously set span names, and only set the span name if it wasn't set previously. This will used most commonly in AppSignal created integrations with other libraries to allow apps to set custom span names.

### Changed

- [cb7c2e9d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/cb7c2e9d607a0035a287db5b7e9485c834fde084) minor - Turn error backend off by default. This will prevent errors from being reported without much context. If you're missing errors after this change, set the `enable_error_backend` config option to `true`, and let us know what errors you're missing at [support@appsignal.com](mailto:support@appsignal.com).
- [4b8bbf75](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/4b8bbf75a3b2defc21d2be2fa401f11980c26c1a) patch - Add debug and error logs to probes to better track what it's doing. This is helpful when debugging issues with the minutely probes system.

## 2.10.2

_Published on 2024-05-14._

### Added

- [1a87c94a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/1a87c94a6f6c1b972aa68507e4a9f1243b9dd570) patch - Support Kamal-based deployments. Read the `KAMAL_VERSION` environment variable, which Kamal exposes within the deployed container, if present, and use it as the application revision if it is not set. This will automatically report deploy markers for applications using Kamal.

### Changed

- [a19671f6](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/a19671f6f165a7957c39516f76a69f08e9e22ab5) patch - Log debug messages when metrics are received for easier debugging.

## 2.10.1

_Published on 2024-04-25._

### Fixed

- [5a7810c8](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/5a7810c81a20961418285b6af8da47694c4b5b16) patch - Fix the Phoenix `filter_parameters` config option support for partial key matches. When configuring `config :phoenix, filter_parameters` with `["key"]` or `{:discard, ["key"]}`, it now also matches partial keys like `"my_key"`, just like Phoenix's logger does.

## 2.10.0

_Published on 2024-04-22._

### Added

- [840e6c0b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/840e6c0bd9934dba1614f7aae3d60350975f3be3) minor - _Heartbeats are currently only available to beta testers. If you are interested in trying it out, [send an email to support@appsignal.com](mailto:support@appsignal.com?subject=Heartbeat%20beta)!_
  
  ---
  
  Add heartbeats support. You can send heartbeats directly from your code, to track the execution of certain processes:
  
  ```elixir
  def send_invoices do
    # ... your code here ...
    Appsignal.heartbeat("send_invoices")
  end
  ```
  
  You can pass a function to `Appsignal.heartbeat`, to report to AppSignal both when the process starts, and when it finishes, allowing you to see the duration of the process:
  
  ```elixir
  def send_invoices do
    Appsignal.heartbeat("send_invoices", fn ->
      # ... your code here ...
    end)
  end
  ```
  
  If an exception is thrown within the function, the finish event will not be reported to AppSignal, triggering a notification about the missing heartbeat. The exception will bubble outside of the heartbeat function.
- [d56d3ebd](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/d56d3ebd2286ee4e4aa75553aeaf49ec1c312bbe) patch - Implement the `ignore_logs` configuration option, which can also be configured as the `APPSIGNAL_IGNORE_LOGS` environment variable.
  
  The value of `ignore_logs` is a list (comma-separated, when using the environment variable) of log line messages that should be ignored. For example, the value `"start"` will cause any message containing the word "start" to be ignored. Any log line message containing a value in `ignore_logs` will not be reported to AppSignal.
  
  The values can use a small subset of regular expression syntax (specifically, `^`, `$` and `.*`) to narrow or expand the scope of lines that should be matched.
  
  For example, the value `"^start$"` can be used to ignore any message that is _exactly_ the word "start", but not messages that merely contain it, like "Process failed to start". The value `"Task .* succeeded"` can be used to ignore messages about task success regardless of the specific task name.

### Fixed

- [38511da4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/38511da476be461bbe2d4f97cf58e5d5ba5e828a) patch - Remove broken link about 1.x upgrade

## 2.9.2

_Published on 2024-03-22._

### Fixed

- [4567ce04](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/4567ce04279ebd53570c84870a81bf7168a91091) patch - Drop non-500 Plug errors in add_error/3

## 2.9.1

_Published on 2024-03-20._

### Added

- [c833c8a4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/c833c8a4bb82febb0a45b1fb8a5fdeff238444be) patch - Implement CPU count configuration option. Use it to override the auto-detected, cgroups-provided number of CPUs that is used to calculate CPU usage percentages.
  
  To set it, use the `cpu_count` configuration option, or the `APPSIGNAL_CPU_COUNT` environment variable.

## 2.9.0

_Published on 2024-03-06._

### Added

- [be785ea9](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/be785ea99d55d04f42639ed7a93b8c5b458240dc) patch - Add histogram support to the OpenTelemetry HTTP server. This allows OpenTelemetry-based instrumentations to report histogram data to AppSignal as distribution metrics.

### Changed

- [2d3130fd](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/2d3130fd5d6bbdcdb91e35f581857e05c8ec292a) minor - **Breaking change**: Normalize CPU metrics for cgroups v1 systems. When we can detect how many CPUs are configured in the container's limits, we will normalize the CPU percentages to a maximum of 100%. This is a breaking change. Triggers for CPU percentages that are configured for a CPU percentage higher than 100% will no longer trigger after this update. Please configure triggers to a percentage with a maximum of 100% CPU percentage.
- [1566a4a8](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/1566a4a8cf0536203027438b01cf1054c4afbf01) patch - Update the Mix config import in the `config/appsignal.exs` file to use `import Config`, rather than the deprecated `use Mix.Config`.
- [2d3130fd](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/2d3130fd5d6bbdcdb91e35f581857e05c8ec292a) patch - Support fractional CPUs for cgroups v2 metrics. Previously a CPU count of 0.5 would be interpreted as 1 CPU. Now it will be correctly seen as half a CPU and calculate CPU percentages accordingly.
- [fb7568ac](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/fb7568aced9ddcf1eb055c590ff1554d603c81a7) patch - Update bundled trusted root certificates.

### Fixed

- [ad0fdb0c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/ad0fdb0c2142eaf53f0129568164ce4c96dd1337) patch - Fix (sub)traces not being reported in their entirety when the OpenTelemetry exporter sends one trace in multiple export requests. This would be an issue for long running traces, that are exported in several requests.

## 2.8.3

_Published on 2024-02-01._

### Added

- [e685b22f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/e685b22f1d56beeedd66587002b4e839896ce1c9) patch - Set data on spans with the `custom_on_create_fun` hook. This hook is called upon the creation of every span. This can be useful to add tags to internal traces and otherwise difficult to access traces.
  
  This won't be necessary for most scenarios. We recommend following [our tagging guide](https://docs.appsignal.com/guides/custom-data/tagging-request.html#elixir) instead.
  
  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Appsignal do
    def custom_on_create_fun(_span) do
      Appsignal.Span.set_sample_data(Appsignal.Tracer.root_span, "tags", %{"locale": "en"})
    end
  end
  ```
  
  ```elixir
  # config/config.exs
  config :appsignal, custom_on_create_fun: &MyApp.Appsignal.custom_on_create_fun/1
  ```

### Changed

- [924a3ffa](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/924a3ffa3e0e456234df3c8a56c4a7cea875c214) patch - Make the debug log message for OpenTelemetry spans from libraries we don't automatically recognize more clear. Mention the span id and the instrumentation library.
- [924a3ffa](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/924a3ffa3e0e456234df3c8a56c4a7cea875c214) patch - Fix an issue where queries containing a MySQL leading type indicator would only be partially sanitised.

## 2.8.2

### Added

- [47f4a8df](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/47f4a8df24250b7985178372e59408b3feae0af8) patch - Add `Appsignal.Ecto.Repo` to support parallel preloads.
  
  For AppSignal to be able to instrument parallel preloads, the current instrumentation context needs to be passed from the Elixir process that spawns the preload to the short-lived processes that run each of the parallel queries.
  
  By replacing `use Ecto.Repo` with `use Appsignal.Ecto.Repo`, the appropriate telemetry context will be passed so that AppSignal can correctly instrument these queries:
  
  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Repo do
    # replace `use Ecto.Repo` with `use Appsignal.Ecto.Repo`
    use Appsignal.Ecto.Repo,
      otp_app: :my_app,
      adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres
  end
  ```

## 2.8.1

### Changed

- [40dc85ef](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/40dc85efb1a9ecb5803dc82c88cb37c1c8ccc72d) patch - Fix disk usage returning a Vec with no entries on Alpine Linux when the `df --local` command fails.
- [92d948fa](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/92d948fa1f8db9546a9074789d7e1ff7264aa720) patch - Add support for lists in the sample data as root values on spans, as shown below. Previously we only supported lists as nested objects in maps.
  
  ```elixir
  Appsignal.Span.set_sample_data(
    Appsignal.Tracer.root_span,
    "custom_data",
    [
      "value 1",
      "value 2"
    ]
  )
  ```

### Removed

- [40dc85ef](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/40dc85efb1a9ecb5803dc82c88cb37c1c8ccc72d) patch - Remove the `appsignal_set_host_gauge` and `appsignal_set_process_gauge` extension functions. These functions were already deprecated and did not report any metrics.

### Fixed

- [9ec351a7](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/9ec351a7e4fc77ac2ca1976191235793f625888d) patch - Fix missing error metrics for the error rate and error count graphs in some scenarios, like with Node.js Koa apps.
- [a339fc1d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/a339fc1d9ef8f8c34c32c5415bd32dbd0cb6b754) patch - Add support for keywords lists in sample data on spans. These would previously be shown an empty list.
  
  ```elixir
  Appsignal.Span.set_sample_data(
    Appsignal.Tracer.root_span,
    "custom_data",
    %{"keyword_list": [foo: "some value", "bar": "other value"]}
  )
  ```

## 2.8.0

### Changed

- [8e8911f0](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/8e8911f0091d5a74633235a5e4371fe0369e405f) minor - Always use Jason to encode JSON. This removes the need to install either Jason or Poison alongside AppSignal, simplifying our installation instructions.
- [9dbf8d82](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/9dbf8d829e5aa4cbb1c73a8c5594cb0b9ab9d31a) patch - Filter more disk mountpoints for disk usage and disk IO stats. This helps reduce noise in the host metrics by focussing on more important mountpoints.
  
  The following mountpoint are ignored. Any mountpoint containing:
  
  - `/etc/hostname`
  - `/etc/hosts`
  - `/etc/resolv.conf`
  - `/snap/`
  - `/proc/`

### Fixed

- [9dbf8d82](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/9dbf8d829e5aa4cbb1c73a8c5594cb0b9ab9d31a) patch - - Support disk usage reporting (using `df`) on Alpine Linux. This host metric would report an error on Alpine Linux.
  - When a disk mountpoint has no inodes usage percentage, skip the mountpoint, and report the inodes information successfully for the inodes that do have an inodes usage percentage.

## 2.7.13

### Changed

- [c883847a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/c883847aff145d35a4d925e54532648c3616da23) patch - Bump agent to eec7f7b
  
  Updated the probes dependency to 0.5.2. CPU usage is now normalized to the number of CPUs available to the container. This means that a container with 2 CPUs will have its CPU usage reported as 50% when using 1 CPU instead of 100%. This is a breaking change for anyone using the cpu probe.
  
  If you have CPU triggers set up based on the old behaviour, you might need to update those to these new normalized values to get the same behaviour. Note that this is needed only if the AppSignal integration package you're using includes this change.

## 2.7.12

### Changed

- [33f08759](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/33f08759b1e4f00fb929d6c5a7d6bd86516048d3) patch - Improve Ecto transaction instrumentation. Queries performed as part of an
  `Ecto.Multi` or an `Ecto.Repo.transaction` were already individually
  instrumented, but now they are displayed in the event timeline as child events
  of a broader transaction event. An additional event is added at the end of the
  transaction, to denote whether the transaction was committed or rolled back.

## 2.7.11

### Changed

- [dae88280](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/dae8828059cf6fe18a3ff042c23988af56e86006) patch - Bump agent to b604345.
  
  - Add an exponential backoff to the retry sleep time to bind to the StatsD, NGINX and OpenTelemetry exporter ports. This gives the agent a longer time to connect to the ports if they become available within a 4 minute window.
  - Changes to the agent logger:
    - Logs from the agent and extension now use a more consistent format in logs for spans and transactions.
    - Logs that are for more internal use are moved to the trace log level and logs that are useful for debugging most support issues are moved to the debug log level. It should not be necessary to use log level 'trace' as often anymore. The 'debug' log level should be enough.
  - Add `running_in_container` to agent diagnose report, to be used primarily by the Python package as a way to detect if an app's host is a container or not.
- [e6c4c79f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/e6c4c79f8096fe88c5d7cc3983e91096e3aa946f) patch - Bump agent to 1dd2a18.
  
  - When adding an SQL body attribute via the extension, instead of truncating the body first and sanitising it later, sanitise it first and truncate it later. This prevents an issue where queries containing very big values result in truncated sanitisations.

### Fixed

- [197e3610](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/197e3610d0c4edfaaa61e3715d46b073f56e115e) patch - Avoid reporting an Oban insert job event as a new incident. This should fix an issue where "insert job" events with little information show up in AppSignal as their own incidents when Oban jobs are inserted from an uninstrumented context that has no parent spans.

## 2.7.10

### Added

- [68ec699e](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/68ec699ead0c82dff11c73dc2ec1cf1cd928d4d0) patch - Implement an Erlang :logger handler for sending logs from AppSignal, in
  preparation for the eventual deprecation of Elixir logger backends.
  
  Add a convenience method to configure this logger handler automatically,
  with the right settings for AppSignal:
  
  ```elixir
  Appsignal.Logger.Handler.add("my_app", :plaintext)
  ```
  
  To remove the logging handler, call the `.remove` method:
  
  ```elixir
  Appsignal.Logger.Handler.remove()
  ```

This is by default set to `127.0.0.1`, which only makes it accessible from the same host. If you want it to be accessible from other machines, use `0.0.0.0` or a specific IP address.
- [08aedeef](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/08aedeefe8715b963587798bbacc4ab1d1f043dd) patch - Report total CPU usage host metric for VMs. This change adds another `state` tag value on the `cpu` metric called `total_usage`, which reports the VM's total CPU usage in percentages.

The `_set_span_attribute_sql_string` function wasn't hooked up, which didn't produce any issues since the SQL queries coming from Ecto don't need to be sanitized any further (sensitive data is already stripped out). This patch still runs them through AppSignal's SQL sanitizer to fix the warning and behave as promised, theoretically.

The error message will now print more details about the installed and expected architecture when they mismatch. This is most common on apps mounted on a container after first being installed on the host with a different architecture than the container.
- [4ac415f1](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/4ac415f19b4cb1a8344e23c3de74effc86ef7eb0) patch - Don't crash at compile time when AppSignal is not configured

  If it is configured, it will print a warning on AppSignal load, but will also retain its
  functionality until the config option is fully removed in the next major release.

### Fixed

- [e4ec8e68](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-elixir/commit/e4ec8e68abb1d625a0a4a0241e52b167a98a9f3d) patch - Prefer the value of the `log_level` config option, instead of the deprecated `debug` config option, when deciding whether to log a debug message. If `log_level` does not have a value, or its value is invalid, the values of the deprecated `debug` and `transaction_debug_mode` config options are taken into account.

  The allowed values are:
  - error
  - warning

- Add Phoenix Telemetry event handler to add Phoenix 1.5 instrumentation. PR #528 & #538

  Before version Phoenix version 1.5. AppSignal’s Phoenix instrumentation
  depended on data from the Phoenix instrumenter, and the installation
  instructions included a step to attach AppSignal’s instrumenter to your
  application in your app’s configuration:

      config :appsignal_phoenix_example, AppsignalPhoenixExampleWeb.Endpoint,
        #...
        instrumenters: [Appsignal.Phoenix.Instrumenter]

  From Phoenix 1.5 on, the old Phoenix instrumentation is deprecated and
  removed in favor of the new Telemetry-based instrumentation. When upgrading
  to Phoenix 1.5, you’ll see a warning during compilation when using the old
  instrumenters:

      [warn] :instrumenters configuration for
      AppsignalPhoenixExampleWeb.Endpoint is deprecated and has no effect

  To switch to the new instrumentation, make sure you're running version 1.12.0
  of the AppSignal integration or higher.  Then, remove the instrumenters
  configuration option from your endpoint configuration.  The new
  instrumentation should appear automatically in your samples as an event named
  call.phoenix_endpoint.
