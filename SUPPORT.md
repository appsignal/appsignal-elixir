# Support

[Contact us][contact] and speak directly with the engineers working on
AppSignal. They will help you get set up, tweak your code and make sure you get
the most out of using AppSignal. You can also find our documentation at
[docs.appsignal.com](https://docs.appsignal.com/).

We do not recommend creating an issue on the Elixir integration's GitHub
project if it concerns your private app data. During the support process we'll
need the AppSignal logs and other resources that contain your app's private
data, something for which the public GitHub issue tracker is not suited.

Please contact us on our website [appsignal.com](https://appsignal.com/) or via
email at [support@appsignal.com][contact].
